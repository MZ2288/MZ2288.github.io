        <p>The basic counter app was my first introduction to ES6 features such as<br>classes, arrow functions, and object destructuring.</p>
<p>The anatomy of this app was to have a smart container component that<br>would pass props to a dumb app component that renders the data passed in as<br>props. This is a common architecture in the React world. In this simple example<br>the app container takes in data and methods from the store and passes them<br>to the app component. Two note worthy features are the static propTypes object<br>which validates props and the process of placing all props in an object in the<br>render method and then passing them at once with the {…props} syntax.</p>
<p>Let’s take a walk through what our store is doing. Redux is distinguished from<br>Flux in that it only uses one store. This store contains all the data for your app.<br>In our counter app we have a store directory with an index.js file that defines our<br>store class. The store class has a state object that is initialized on creation<br>of a store class instance. The state object contains one property, count, which<br>is initially set to zero.</p>
<p>Next the observe method of our store class is defined. This takes a callback<br>function as a parameter. This callback function is assigned as the value of<br>the store class’s observer property. emitChange is a store class instance method<br>that calls the observer callback function. Note in the index.js (webpack entry point)<br>file at the root level of our app directory we create a store and give its<br>observer callback function. The function we give is for ReactDOM to render our<br>AppContainer component inside the id=app DOM element. What this ultimately translates<br>to is that when emitChange occurs (which is called whenever the store’s state is changed)<br>the entire App re-renders. To those familiar with React this is obvious, this is<br>the whole point of one-way data flow.</p>
<p>Our store class defines the methods inc and dec which alter the state of the store<br>and thus call emitChange. At the bottom of the file we then export our createStore<br>function which initializes a store as long as one doesn’t already exist. This<br>check is because in accordance with the Redux architecture the store should be<br>a singleton object.</p>
<p>The multi-counter app takes the basic counter app and extends to allow for an<br>arbitrary number of counters. This is achieved by storing an array of instances<br>of a counter class in the store’s state object. These counter class instances<br>have attributes (count) and methods (inc, dec, reset) in good ol’ fashioned<br>OO design. This allows us to pass the store to the AppContainer component and<br>destructure the store prop, extracting the methods we defined and calling them<br>on the click of buttons, which in turn causes everything to re-render with the<br>updated data.</p>
<p>The qsort app takes the same basic architecture of our counter apps. It has an app directory<br>with a root level index.js file that serves as our webpack entry point for our build.<br>This file imports the appropriate modules like React, ReactDOM, the store, and AppContainer.<br>A root DOM node is selected and the store’s observer callback is ReactDOM.render with<br>our AppContainer component given store as a prop, which is then placed inside our<br>selected DOM node.</p>
<p>This app becomes a little more complicated in how we visualize the progression of<br>quicksort using recursive method calls in our store.</p>
<p>To refresh your memory, quicksort is a sorting algorithm that takes an array of<br>sortable values, selects a pivot, partitions the array around this pivot, and returns<br>the concatenation of a recursive call to the left (smaller) partition, the pivot itself,<br>and a recursive call to right (greater) partition.</p>
